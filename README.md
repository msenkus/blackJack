"# blackJack" 
Release builds is the directory where the exe is located. 
The name of the app is electron-tutorial-app.exe. The shopping care icon comes from a random website.

The rest of the files in this Directory are both source files as well as package files used for electron.

The assets folder is where the icon is saved. Without that the program may not run.

The node file is from nativefier in which was used in experimenting with serving up blackjack folder on a port and 
    creating a native application with it.

This project was created while taking a JS class through pluralsight, an online learning platform. Creating a deck of cards is one of the best example I have found to wrap object oriented programming up and hit a mile stone at the time. The program creates 52 objects (cards) and used a simple loop to assign each card a suit and number attribute. Then using a stack data structure, pops a card off the eck (stack) every time a card is dealt.
